# Changelogs

### June 16, 2025

- **Search collections**: We’ve added a text field to the managed collections list so you can search for the collection you’re looking for.

### June 8, 2025

- **New metafield support**: We've added support for metafields that store **metaobject** and **list of metaobjects**. They can be used to filters products that have a given metaobject.

### June 5, 2025

- **Fixed tag filtering**: When you use "is not equal" or "does not contain" for tags, the condition now correctly skips any product with at least one tag matching the condition.
- **Renamed and added stock filters**: The old **Inventory stock** filter is now called **Total inventory stock**, and there’s a new **Variant inventory stock** filter so you can choose products based on the stock of each variant.

### June 3, 2025

- **Improved metafields search**: When selecting a condition (product field or metafield), the list is now searchable. Additionally, product metafields and variant metafields are divided into two sections for easier navigation.

### June 2, 2025

- **New filtering operators**: In addition to the existing operators such as "equal," "greater than," etc., we've added new operators **"is empty"** and **"is not empty"**. They have been added for all **metafields** and the product field **"compare-at price"**, allowing filtering of blank data.
